# Machine Learning to Predict Browsing Selection of Ungulates in Forest Habitats
## Zs√≥fia Katona - Bachelor Project AI, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

This collection contains the implementation of three machine learning models applied to the task of predicting ungulates' selective browsing behavior in forest habitats. It comprises the original dataset used in the study as well as the following Notebooks, which should be used in the specified order to replicate the process followed in the project:

1. **Data_preparation.ipynb**
   * Creates the dataset used to construct the ML models based on the raw data files contained in the directory *Forests*.
  
2. **Data_inspection.ipynb**
